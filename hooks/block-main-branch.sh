#
# 1. Blocks any force-push flag (--force, -f, --force-with-lease) in git push.
# 2. Blocks git commit on protected branches, and git push with no explicit branch
#    (which would implicitly push the current branch). Explicit-target pushes like
#    "git push origin feat/foo" are allowed here; the refspec check handles those.
# 3. Blocks explicit pushes targeting protected branches regardless of current branch,
#    including refspec-style pushes (HEAD:main, refs/heads/main).
#
# Protected branches: defaults to main, master, dev, staging, production. Override by setting
# AGENTGUARD_PROTECTED_BRANCHES to a comma-separated list, e.g.:
#   export AGENTGUARD_PROTECTED_BRANCHES="main,master,develop,trunk"
#
# Shared hook — used by both Claude (Bash tool) and Kiro (execute_bash tool).
# Static deny rules cannot inspect git state — this hook runs in the actual
# working directory so it can call git at runtime.
#
# Matching strategy: all git invocations are anchored to a statement boundary —
# start-of-string or a shell separator (;  &&  ||  |  $() — so that a command
# like `echo "git commit"` does not trigger a block.  We do not attempt full
# shell parsing; the anchor eliminates the most common false-positive pattern
# (string arguments containing git subcommands) without adding fragility.
#
# Exit 2 = blocked. The agent receives the stderr message as feedback.
